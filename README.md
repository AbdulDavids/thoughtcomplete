# thoughtcomplete

a writing app i made. enjoy.

distraction-free freewriting for macOS — no popups, no dropdowns, no noise. just you and the page.

---

## what it does

- **ghost-text autocomplete** — AI suggests continuations as you type, accept with Tab or →
- **freewrite timer** — set a duration, start writing, stop thinking
- **saved thoughts** — save anything worth keeping, browse and edit it later
- **cycling controls** — font, size, timer all cycle on click. no menus.

## built with

- SwiftUI + AppKit on macOS 26
- Apple Foundation Models (on-device, private)
- no external dependencies. just UserDefaults and vibes.
